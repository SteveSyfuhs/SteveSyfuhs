# Steve Syfuhs

I'm a dev on the Cryptography, Identity, and Authentication team at Microsoft building authentication services and stuff for Windows and friends. I've most recently been working on credential protection.

If you're interested in that sort of history there's LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/syfuhs/

I have some things written down at https://syfuhs.net/.
